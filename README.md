TASK 1: Customer Churn rate analysis
NAME : OMER ABDULLAH

Business Problem Overview

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another.
In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that
it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to 
predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, it is analysed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, built predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and 
identifies the main indicators of churn.

What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has
an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great,
outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts
only on these "high risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customers loyalty. The core to succeed in this market lies in the
customer itself.

Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.

To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels.
As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also grow and thrive. More customers they have in their network, 
the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective
retention strategy.
